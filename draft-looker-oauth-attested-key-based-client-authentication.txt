            OAuth2 Attested Key Based Client Authentication
   draft-looker-oauth-attested-key-based-client-authentication-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines a new method of client authentication for
   OAuth2 [RFC6749] by extending the approach defined in [RFC7521].
   This new method enables client deployments that are traditionally
   viewed as public clients to be able to authenticate with the
   authorization server through an attested key based authentication
   scheme.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7521] defines a way for a client to include an assertion in a
   token request to an authorization server for the purposes of client
   authentication.  This specification extends this mechanism to provide
   a way for a client instance to authenticate it self with the
   authorization server through an attested key based authentication
   scheme.

   The following diagram depicts the conceptual interactions.

                              Key Attestation PoP

   Note defining the protocol for steps 2 and 4, including how the
   client instance authenticates with the client backend is out of scope
   of this specification.

   This specification only defines the format of the client assertion
   that a client instance uses to authenticate in its interactions with
   an authorization server (indicated in step 6), which is comprised of
   two key parts:

   1.  A client key attestation - produced by the client backend.

   2.  A client key attestation proof of possession (PoP) - produced by
       the client instance.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Client Authentication in the Token Request

   To perform client authentication using this scheme, the client
   instance uses the following parameter values and encodings.

   The value of the "client_assertion_type" is
   "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-key-attestation".

   The value of the "client_assertion" parameter contains two JWTs,
   separated by a '~' character.  It MUST NOT contain more or less than
   precisely two JWTs seperated by the '~` character.  The first JWT
   MUST be the client key attestation JWT defined in Section 3.1.1, the
   second JWT MUST the client key attestation PoP defined in
   Section 3.1.2.

   The following example demonstrates client authentication using this
   scheme during the presentation of an authorization code grant in an
   access token request (with extra line breaks for display purposes
   only):

POST /token.oauth2 HTTP/1.1
Host: as.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&
code=n0esc3NRze7LTCu7iYzS6a5acc3f0ogp4&
client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3A

IjIyIn0[...omitted for brevity...].
iOiJSUzI1[...omitted for brevity...]

3.1.  JWT Format and Processing Requirements

   In order to authenticate the client using this scheme, the
   authorization server MUST validate BOTH the JWTs present in the
   "client_assertion" parameter according to the criteria below.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the authorization server validate the Client
   Key Attestation prior to validating the Client Key Attestation PoP.

3.1.1.  Client Key Attestation JWT

   The following rules apply to validating the client key attestation
   JWT.  Application of additional restrictions and policy are at the
   discretion of the authorization server.

   1.   The JWT MUST contain an "iss" (issuer) claim that contains a
        unique identifier for the entity that issued the JWT.  In the
        absence of an application profile specifying otherwise,
        compliant applications MUST compare issuer values using the
        Simple String Comparison method defined in Section 6.2.1 of
        [RFC3986].

   2.   The JWT MUST contain a "sub" (subject) claim with a value
        corresponding to the "client_id" of the OAuth client.

   3.   The JWT MUST contain an "exp" (expiration time) claim that
        limits the time window during which the JWT can be used.  The
        authorization server MUST reject any JWT with an expiration time
        that has passed, subject to allowable clock skew between
        systems.

   4.   The JWT MUST contain an "cnf" claim conforming [RFC7800] that
        conveys the key to be used for sender constraining tokens issued
        by the authorization server.  The key MUST be expressed using
        the "jwk" representation.

   5.   The JWT MAY contain an "nbf" (not before) claim that identifies
        the time before which the token MUST NOT be accepted for
        processing.

   6.   The JWT MAY contain an "iat" (issued at) claim that identifies
        the time at which the JWT was issued.

   7.   The JWT MAY contain a "jti" (JWT ID) claim that provides a
        unique identifier for the token.  The authorization server MAY
        ensure that JWTs are not replayed by maintaining the set of used
        "jti" values for the length of time for which the JWT would be
        considered valid based on the applicable "exp" instant.

   8.   The JWT MAY contain other claims.

   9.   The JWT MUST be digitally signed using an asymmetric
        cryptographic algorithm.  The authorization server MUST reject
        the JWT if it is using a Message Authentication Code (MAC) based
        algorithm.  The authorization server MUST reject JWTs with an
        invalid signature.

   10.  The authorization server MUST reject a JWT that is not valid in
        all other respects per "JSON Web Token (JWT)" [RFC7519].

   The following example is the decoded header and payload of a JWT
   meeting the processing rules as defined above.

   {
     "alg": "ES256",
     "kid": "11"
   }
   .
   {
     "iss": "https://client.example.com",
     "sub": "https://client.example.com",
     "nbf":1300815780,
     "exp":1300819380,
     "cnf": {
       "jwk": {
         "kty": "EC",
         "use": "sig",
         "crv": "P-256",
         "x": "18wHLeIgW9wVN6VD1Txgpqy2LszYkMf6J8njVAibvhM",
         "y": "-V4dS4UaLMgP_4fY4j8ir7cl1TXlFdAgcx55o7TkcSA"
       }
     }
   }

3.1.2.  Client Key Attestation PoP JWT

   The following rules apply to validating the client key attestation
   PoP JWT.  Application of additional restrictions and policy are at
   the discretion of the authorization server.

   1.   The JWT MUST contain an "iss" (issuer) claim with a value
        corresponding to the "client_id" of the OAuth client.

   2.   The JWT MUST contain an "exp" (expiration time) claim that
        limits the time window during which the JWT can be used.  The
        authorization server MUST reject any JWT with an expiration time
        that has passed, subject to allowable clock skew between
        systems.  Note that the authorization server may reject JWTs
        with an "exp" claim value that is unreasonably far in the
        future.

   3.   The JWT MUST contain a "jti" (JWT ID) claim that provides a
        unique identifier for the token.  The authorization server MAY
        ensure that JWTs are not replayed by maintaining the set of used
        "jti" values for the length of time for which the JWT would be
        considered valid based on the applicable "exp" instant.

   4.   The JWT MUST contain an "aud" (audience) claim containing a
        value that identifies the authorization server as an intended
        audience.  The [RFC8414] issuer identifier URL of the
        authorization server MUST be used as a value for an "aud"
        element to identify the authorization server as the intended
        audience of the JWT.

   5.   The JWT MAY contain an "nbf" (not before) claim that identifies
        the time before which the token MUST NOT be accepted for
        processing.

   6.   The JWT MAY contain an "iat" (issued at) claim that identifies
        the time at which the JWT was issued.  Note that the
        authorization server may reject JWTs with an "iat" claim value
        that is unreasonably far in the past.

   7.   The JWT MAY contain other claims.

   8.   The JWT MUST be digitally signed using an asymmetric
        cryptographic algorithm.  The authorization server MUST reject
        the JWT if it is using a Message Authentication Code (MAC) based
        algorithm.  The authorization server MUST reject JWTs with an
        invalid signature.

   9.   The public key used to verify the JWT MUST be the key located in
        the "cnf" claim of the corresponding client key attestation JWT.

   10.  The authorization server MUST reject a JWT that is not valid in
        all other respects per "JSON Web Token (JWT)" [RFC7519].

   The following example is the decoded header and payload of a JWT
   meeting the processing rules as defined above.

   {
     "alg": "ES256"
   }
   .
   {
     "iss": "https://client.example.com",
     "aud": "https://as.example.com",
     "nbf":1300815780,
     "exp":1300819380,
   }

4.  Implementation Considerations

4.1.  Re use of a Client Attestation JWT

   Implementers should be aware that the design of this authentication
   mechanism deliberately allows for a client instance to re-use a
   single Client Attestation JWT in multiple interactions/requests with
   an authorization server, whilst producing a fresh Client Attestation
   PoP JWT.  Client deployments should consider this when determining
   the validity period for issued Client Attestation JWTs as this
   ultimately controls how long a client instance can re-use a single
   Client Attestation JWT.

4.2.  Refresh token binding

   Authorization servers issuing a refresh token in response to a token
   request using the "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-
   key-attestation" client authentication method MUST bind the refresh
   token to the client instance, and NOT just the client as specified in
   section 6 [@!RFC6749].  To prove this binding, the client instance
   MUST authenticate itself to the authorization server when refreshing
   an access token using the "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-
   type:jwt-key-attestation" authentication method.  The client MUST
   also use the same client attestation key that was used for
   authentication when the refresh token was issued.

5.  Privacy Considerations

5.1.  Client Instance Tracking Across Authorization Servers

   Implementers should be aware that using the same client attestation
   across multiple authorization servers could result in correlation of
   the end user using the client instance through claim values
   (including the public key in the cnf claim).  Client deployments are
   therefore RECOMMENDED to use different client attestations across
   different authorization servers.

6.  Security Considerations

   TODO

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Sub-Namespace Registration of urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-
      assertion-type:jwt-key-attestation

   This section registers the value "client-assertion-type:jwt-key-
   attestation" in the IANA "OAuth URI" registry established by "An IETF
   URN Sub-Namespace for OAuth" [RFC6755].

   o URN: urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-key-
   attestation o Common Name: OAuth2 Attested Key Based Client
   Authentication Authentication o Change Controller: IESG o
   Specification Document: TBC

7.2.  Registration of attest_key_client_auth Token Endpoint
      Authentication Method

   This section registers the value "attest_key_client_auth" in the IANA
   "OAuth Token Endpoint Authentication Methods" registry established by
   OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [RFC7591].

   o Token Endpoint Authentication Method Name: "attest_key_client_auth"
   o Change Controller: IESG o Specification Document(s): TBC
